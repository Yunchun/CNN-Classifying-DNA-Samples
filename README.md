# DNA-Differentiation
I conducted a machine learning project on differentiating DNA sequences. I encoded DNA sequences using one-hot encoding. Moreover, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network model and trained the model with these sequences. The performance of the model is also evaluated and improved in the process.
